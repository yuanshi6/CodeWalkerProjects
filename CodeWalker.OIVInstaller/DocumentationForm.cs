@"OIV Installer - User Guide
==========================

1. Installation
   - The window opens on an empty landing card. Drag any .oiv or .rpf onto it,
     or click 'Browse...' next to OIV Package to pick one.
   - The card disappears and the package's description, info, and an Install
     button slide in. The window grows to fit the content.
   - Select your GTA V game folder (auto-validated for Legacy / Enhanced).
   - Click 'Install'.
   - FiveM Support: Drag and drop a .RPF file to automatically install it to your FiveM mods folder.
     (Automatically detects path via Registry or %LocalAppData%).

2. Previewing What an OIV Will Do
   - After picking a package, a 'View install steps →' link appears below the
     description.
   - Click it to open a read-only inspector showing every operation the OIV
     declares: archive edits, file adds / deletes, text-file inserts / replaces,
     XML / PSO add / replace / remove, defragmentation.
   - The tree on the left lists each operation; selecting a node shows the
     full details (source paths, XPath expressions, full content) on the right.
   - Useful for sanity-checking a package's scope before installing it.

3. After Install
   - Click 'Done' on the install log to return to the empty landing card,
     ready for the next package.
   - The previous .oiv is dropped automatically so the Install button can't
     fire twice against the same package.

4. Uninstalling & Conflicts
   - If you try to install a package that is already installed, the installer will detect the conflict.
   - You can choose to:
     A) Uninstall & Revert to Backup:
        - Smart Revert: Attempts to undo specific text/XML changes, preserving other mods' edits.
        - Full Backup: Restores exact file backup if smart revert is not applicable.
     B) Uninstall & Reset to Vanilla: Wipes the files and replaces them with original game versions.
     C) Keep Existing: Installs the new mod on top of the old one (Stacking).

5. Skip Backup (Optional)
   - The 'Skip backup' checkbox at the bottom-right of the paths panel will
     install the package without recording any backup data.
   - Trade-off: the install is faster and uses no disk space for backups,
     but the package will NOT show up in Manage Mods and cannot be reverted
     through this tool. Use only when you don't intend to uninstall later.

6. Managing Mods
   - Use the 'Manage Mods' button to see a list of installed packages.
   - You can uninstall packages individually from there.

7. Backups
   - Backups are stored in your game folder under 'OIV_Uninstall_Data'.
   - Do not verify/repair via Steam/Epic/Launcher while mods are installed if you plan to uninstall them via this tool, as it might desync the backup state.

8. Supported Features (OpenIV 2.2 Format)
   - Full metadata support (name, version, author, description, colors).
   - XML editing with XPath (add, replace, remove operations).
   - Text file editing (insert, replace, delete operations).
   - PSO/META editing inside RPF archives (YMT, YMF, YMAP, YTYP).
   - Nested RPF creation (createIfNotExist at any depth).
   - Supports GTA V Legacy & Enhanced (Gen9) Versions.
   - <gameversion> validation (Warns if package requires Enhanced/Legacy mismatch).

9. Command Line Interface (CLI)
   - The installer supports full automation via command line.
   - Usage: CodeWalker.OIVInstaller.exe [options]
   - Options:
     --install <path>       Install an OIV package
     --uninstall <name>     Uninstall a package by name
     --uninstall-oiv <path> Uninstall by reading package name from OIV file
     --list                 List installed packages
     --set-game <path>      Set default game folder
     --get-game             Get default game folder
     --browse               Open folder picker to set game folder
     --force                Ignore GameVersion warnings
     --skip_backup          Do not back up original files (saves space)
     --help                 Show all options

   - Automation:
     If no game folder is set, CLI commands will open a folder picker dialog.
     Example batch scripts for automation are available in the repository:
     https://github.com/crxhvrd/CodeWalkerProjects/tree/master

REMAINING TODO:

1. Archive Management
   [ ] Implement actual 'Defragmentation' logic (currently a placeholder).

2. UI Improvements
   [ ] Display extended metadata (License, Social Media links) in the main window.
   [ ] Smooth color tween for header theme on loaded <-> empty transition
       (currently snaps to default blue).

3. Core Features
   [ ] Add full transaction support for safer installations (rollback on crash).
   [ ] Validating 'Condition' attributes for file content more rigorously.

4. Enhanced Installation Features
   [ ] Implement 'Enhanced' mod installation flow (Vortex-style).
       - Allow installing not only a single mod package but also choosing optional components.
   [ ] Automatic dependencies installation (OpenIV.asi / OpenRPF.asi / RageOpenV.asi, ASI Loader).

@"OpenIV 2.2 Feature Support & Uninstall Logic
============================================

The following table details how each OIV 2.2 feature is handled during installation and uninstallation (Manage Mods).

1. FILE OPERATIONS
------------------
- <add> (New File)
  Install: Copies file to game/mods folder.
  Uninstall: Deletes the file.

- <add> (Replace File)
  Install: Backs up original file, then overwrites.
  Uninstall: Restores the original file from backup.

- <delete>
  Install: Backs up target file, then deletes it.
  Uninstall: Restores the deleted file from backup.

2. ARCHIVE OPERATIONS
---------------------
- <archive> (createIfNotExist=""True"")
  Install: Creates new RPF archive.
  Uninstall: Deletes the created archive.

- <archive> (Edit Existing)
  Install: Opens archive to perform inner operations.
  Uninstall: Reverses inner operations (see below).

3. TEXT EDITING (Smart Revert)
------------------------------
- <add> (Append Line)
- <insert> (Before/After)
- <replace>
- <delete>

  Install: Tracks specific line changes.
  Uninstall: SMART REVERT - Attempts to reverse ONLY the specific lines changed by this mod.
             (e.g., removes inserted lines, restores replaced lines).
             If Smart Revert fails, restores the full file backup.

4. XML / PSO EDITING (Smart Revert)
-----------------------------------
- <add> (First/Last/Before/After)
- <replace>
- <remove>

  Install: Tracks specific XPath operations.
  Uninstall: SMART REVERT - Attempts to reverse ONLY the specific node changes.
             (e.g. removes added nodes, restores removed nodes).
             If Smart Revert fails, restores the full file backup.

5. METADATA & COLORS
--------------------
- Handled purely by the installer UI. No game file impact.

6. COMPATIBILITY CHECKS
-----------------------
- <gameversion>
  Validates if the target game folder (Legacy/Enhanced) matches the package requirement.
  Shows a warning if mismatched, but permits installation.

7. ADD-ON CONTENT (DLCs)
------------------------
- Addon RPFs (e.g. dlc.rpf)
  Install: Copied via <content> or created via <archive>. Use backup system to track as 'Added'.
  Uninstall: The added .rpf file is DELETED. Parent folders (e.g. dlcpacks/modname) are removed if empty.

- dlclist.xml Updates
  Install: Typically done via XML <add> command.
  Uninstall: Reversed via Smart XML Revert (the added line is removed), keeping other mods intact.

8. FIVEM SUPPORT
----------------
- .RPF Installation
  Install: Direct copy to registry-detected path or %localappdata%\FiveM\FiveM.app\mods. (Creates mods folder if needed).
  Uninstall: Deletes the .rpf file. (Shows 'Remove Mod' confirmation).
- Metadata
  Reads assembly.xml from inside the RPF to display mod info.
